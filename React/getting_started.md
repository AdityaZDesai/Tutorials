Getting Started With React

Before getting started, here is my summary on the best react practices that we should be following as developers.
	1) Use functional Components instead of Class Components.
	React consists of these things called Components, which are essentially rendered components. In the previous 	    version of React, these components could be the form Classes, but now they are in the form of functions. 

	2) Creating components that can be reused. It makes the code easier to understand. For example if you are cr        eating a Navbar, then it should consist of button components, instead of creating a single Navbar component. 
	3)Make sure all the CSS is placed within the css file, so that it can be reused, and avoid having inline CSS.
	
	4) Use arrow functions, because better syntax.
